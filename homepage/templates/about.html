            Welcome to <strong>Istar</strong> — a place crafted not by algorithms or oversight, but by the will of those who dare to write.

        <p>
            Named in homage to <strong>Istaroth</strong>, the enigmatic Shade of Time from Teyvat’s mythos, this platform is built on the belief that ideas, no matter how fleeting, deserve a space to be heard.
            Here, time bends for your voice — unmonitored, unfiltered, and unbothered.
        </p>
