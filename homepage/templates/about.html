      <strong>Istar</strong> is a platform created for those who value unfiltered expression. It’s not shaped by algorithms, corporate influence, or moderation overreach — it’s shaped by <em>you</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by <strong>Istaroth</strong>, the enigmatic Shade of Time from Teyvat's lore, Istar is built on the idea that every thought — fleeting or profound — deserves its moment. Here, time slows down for your voice.

    <p>
      To build a space where content can exist freely and authentically — a digital shrine to expression where even your most fleeting thoughts are given weight.

      So speak. Post. Whisper into the void. Time is listening.
